### Code examples
*Where my anagrams at? (Python)*
```
def anagrams(word, words):
    out = []
    for i in words:
        if sum(map(ord, word)) == sum(map(ord, i)): 
            out.append(i)
    return out
```
*Reversed Strings (C#)*
```
using System;

public static class Kata
{
  public static string Solution(string str) 
  {
    string outlet = "";
            for (int i = str.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
                outlet += str[i];
                
    return outlet;
  }
}
```
